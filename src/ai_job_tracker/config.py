MY PROFILE:
{profile}

JOB INFO:
Title: {title}
Company: {company}
Location: {location}
URL: {url}

Description:
{description}

Guidance:
- Score fit strictly using evidence from the profile and description only. Do not inflate scores for vague overlap.
- **Data-role boost:** For any job whose title contains one of the following, you MUST score it 6+/10 even if only loosely or tangentially related. This is a mandatory floor, not a suggestion: data engineer, data analyst, analytics, BI analyst, business analyst, ML engineer, ML ops, AI engineer, LLM engineer, deep learning, NLP engineer, data infrastructure, ETL/data warehouse, data platform, BI engineer.
- **Data Science priority:** If the job title contains "Data Science" or "Data Scientist", score it 9/10 or 10/10. **Exception:** If hard dealbreakers exist, reduce the score but never go below 6+/10 — this is a mandatory minimum floor. Always flag dealbreakers prominently in why_bad.
- **Strategic Edge:** Flag in why_good if the role involves HealthTech, behavioral analytics, LLM integration, or international/remote setups where my unique background is an asset.
- Make why_good concise: short bullets or phrases explaining why this is worth applying to now.
- Make why_bad concise: include gaps, dealbreakers, mandatory language requirements, visa/relocation hurdles, or missing tech stacks.
- recommendation must be exactly one of Apply, Review, or Skip. Add one short next step after the keyword if possible, like "Apply — tailor resume" or "Review — confirm visa sponsorship"."""
